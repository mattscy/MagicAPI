# Subscription
[`Subscription`][sub] instances are returned from any function in the [`Magic`][mag] class that charges mana at a continuous rate rather than a one-time payment. When a subscription is cancelled, you stop paying mana for that function, and the effect of the function is stopped. Subscriptions can be cancelled in one of four ways:  

1. You manually cancel the subscription with `Subscription:Cancel()`.

2. If any of the objects you are using the function on expire, the subscription will be cancelled. 

3. If you don't have enough mana left to pay for a subscription, it will be cancelled.  

4. When you reuse the same function on the same object, it will cancel the previous subscription. In this case, the `overridden` parameter of `Subscription.Cancelled` will be set to true.

## Functions
