# Object
All objects that you can manipulate in the game are inherited from the `Object` class. Models, parts and characters are all examples of objects that you can use magic on. An object can either be classified as "friendly" if it belongs to you or one of your teammates, "enemy" if it belongs to a player on another team, and "neutral" otherwise.

After a certain amount of time passes, an object will expire, and you can no longer call its methods or use it in the `Magic` class. The lifetime of an object is different depending on how it is obtained:
- If obtained from the `Magic:GetObject` function, the object will expire after any yield.
- If obtained from the `Magic:GetLingeringObject` function, the object will expire after the returned subscription is cancelled.
- Any objects will expire after they are destroyed.

However, some `HitDetails` objects have an associated lifetime that will be used instead of the above conditions. For example, the `HitDetails` that is obtained from `Magic:GetRadiusDetectionSignal` when `entered` is true will give an object that expires after the object leaves the radius, rather than after an amount of time.
