It manages your mana and provides all the functions that you can use to manipulate objects in the game. Mana is a measurement of your magical potential, similarly to how stamina is a measurement of physical potential. You can spend mana to achieve all kinds of magical effects. Most of the functions in the Magic class cost an amount of mana depending on the arguments that you give. For example, the Magic:Fling function can be used to fling an object by temporarily setting its velocity. However, using a velocity with a larger magnitude will cost more mana. It is also important keep in mind that using functions on enemy objects is often more expensive than using the same functions on friendly objects. This class also lets you retrieve the Character object that represents your character using the Mana:GetMyCharacter function.
